# Eastern African Power Pool Modeling with PyPSA-Earth

This repository contains the files and scripts for modeling the Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP) using [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth), a powerful open-source framework for simulating energy systems. The EAPP model aims to evaluate the energy system of the region, integrating renewable energy resources and enhancing energy trading between Eastern African countries.

## Project Overview

The EAPP covers the following member countries:
- Egypt
- Ethiopia
- Kenya
- Uganda
- Djibouti
- Rwanda
- Burundi
- Tanzania
- Libya
- Somalia
- South Sudan
- Sudan
- Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
